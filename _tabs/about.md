My name is Yu-Lin Huang, and I am a assistant professor in the Department of Water Resources and Environmental Engineering at Tamkang University, Taiwan.

My research focuses on fluid mechanics, with particular emphasis on gravity currents and turbulence. I employ a combination of laboratory experiments and computational fluid dynamics to investigate these flows.

Currently, I am using the Nek5000 spectral element solver to simulate gravity-driven flows, with the goal of gaining deeper insights into their propagation structures under varying geometries and buoyancy conditions.
